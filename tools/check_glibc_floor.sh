# Fail the build if any shipped ELF demands a glibc newer than the floor.
#
# A PortMaster port lands on CFWs whose glibc is years older than the machine
# it was cross-compiled on. A binary (or bundled .so) references the highest
# GLIBC_x.y symbol version present in the toolchain it was built with, and the
# device's dynamic linker refuses to load it if it cannot satisfy that version:
# "GLIBC_2.34 not found". ArkOS/AeolusUX ship glibc 2.28-2.31, so anything above
# 2.31 breaks them - and the qemu/Mesa harness never catches it, because it runs
# on a modern host with a new glibc. This gate is the thing that does catch it,
# at build time, before the zip is ever shipped.
#
# Run inside the build container (needs the cross readelf), e.g. from `make libs`:
#
# GLIBC_FLOOR overrides the ceiling (default 2.31 = Debian bullseye).
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`/`pipefail`: the whole job of this script is to reach
# a verdict, and the normal case (a version does not exceed the floor, a file
# has no GLIBC refs at all) makes those benign non-zero exits. A build gate that
# aborts on its own successful checks is worse than useless. Errors are handled
# explicitly instead.
