/*
 * 32-bit time_t, because the game has one and the host does not.
 *
 * Debian trixie moved armhf to 64-bit time_t. bionic's armeabi-v7a time_t
 * clock_gettime straight to the host's - which is what the generated bionic
 * table does, and what works on distros that have not made the switch - hands
 * the kernel a 16-byte struct timespec to fill in where the game reserved 8:
 *
 *     xt::Time::getSeconds():
 *         sub  sp, #16
 *         str  <canary>, [sp, #12]
 *         add  r1, sp, #4        ; struct timespec
 *         blx  clock_gettime
 *
 * The extra eight bytes land on the stack canary and the process dies in
 * __stack_chk_fail before the game has drawn anything. It is not a subtle
 * failure, but it is a silent one: nothing in the log points at time_t.
 *
 * gettimeofday is the same bug with a nastier landing. The caller is a
 * microsecond-clock helper at module+0x237740, and it does not have a canary:
 *
 *     push {r4, lr}          ; [sp+8] = r4, [sp+12] = return address
 *     sub  sp, sp, #8        ; [sp+0..7] = struct timeval, all of it
 *     mov  r0, sp
 *     bl   gettimeofday      ; host writes 16 bytes, not 8
 *     ldm  sp, {r0, r2}      ; tv_sec, tv_usec
 *     ...
 *     pop  {r4, pc}          ; <- pc
 *
 * The host's 64-bit tv_usec is written at [sp+8..15]: its low word lands on
 * the saved r4 and its high word - zero, because microseconds never fill 32
 * bits - lands on the saved return address. So the function computes the right
 * timestamp, stores it correctly, and then returns to address zero.
 *
 * That is what the run log showed before this entry existed:
 *
 *     FATAL: SIGSEGV at 0x00000000
 *            pc = 0x00000000  lr = <libc>  r0 = 0x6a6bab71  r1 = 0x000f4240
 *
 * r0 is a live Unix timestamp and r1 is 1000000, which is the sec-to-usec
 * multiply about to happen two instructions later - the smoking gun, and the
 * reason this is not the missing-JNI-class crash it was mistaken for. The
 * fake-class warnings printed just above it are real but unrelated: the engine
 * survives every one of them, because a NULL jmethodID goes through the JNI
 * shim's null checks and comes back as a zero return value, not a jump.
 *
 * Every function here therefore takes the game's layout, calls the host with
 * the host's, and narrows across the boundary. These entries come before the
 * generated libc table in so_dynamic_libraries so they win the lookup.
 *
 * Narrowing is lossless until 2038; past that the game sees a wrapped clock,
 * exactly as it would on a real armeabi-v7a device.
