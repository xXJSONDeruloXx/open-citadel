/*
 * Milestone tracing.
 *
 * The harness cannot ask the port "did it work?"; it can only read what the
 * port prints. Every observable milestone (module loaded, onCreate returned,
 * gl ready, frame, non-black framebuffer) is announced through trace() so the
 * verification script asserts on facts instead of on the absence of a crash.
 *
 * Enabled by LOADER_TRACE=1 so a released port stays quiet.
