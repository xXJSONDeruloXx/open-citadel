/*
 * Path-translating wrappers around the libc entry points the game opens files
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What was observed
 *
 * `qemu-arm -strace` the very first thing it does is:
 *
 *
 * That is a literal Android URI reaching the host kernel. Two things are worth
 * naming about it:
 *
 *   - the engine does NOT strip the scheme itself. On Android it never had to:
 *     "appbundle:" was the flag that sent the name down the AssetManager path,
 *     and the AssetManager was handed the remainder. With that branch patched
 *     out, whoever answers open() has to do the stripping.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The rules
 *
 * Taken from fix_path() in vita-ref/loader/reimpl/io.c, which runs this exact
 * build, rather than invented here:
 *
 *   appbundle:/X                            -> <gamedir>/assets/X
 *
 * The second and third exist because the engine also builds absolute paths out
 * of the app data directory it thinks it has. They are applied in that order
 * and are not mutually exclusive: a path can need the prefix removed and then
 * the published/ rewrite.
 *
 * One deliberate divergence from the reference. After those rules a path can
 * still be rooted somewhere that does not exist here (the Vita port's data
 * directory is a constant; ours is argv[1] and only known at runtime), so a
 * game directory. Without that, any name the engine derives from
 * GetAppDataDirectory - a JNI call this port answers with NULL - would land
 * outside the mounted tree and fail the same silent ENOENT way the scheme did.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why wrappers and not a chdir or a symlink farm
 *
 * "appbundle:" is not a path at all, so no amount of cwd or mount trickery
 * reaches it; it has to be rewritten by something. And the rewrite has to
 * happen on the libc boundary rather than by patching the engine's string
 * building, because the same names are built in several places (the ini
 * loader, the package reader, the save system) and only one of them was ever
 * disassembled.
 *
 * No allocation happens in here. The engine calls open() from inside its own
 * allocator's core-acquisition path, so a fix_path() that malloc'd - as the
 * reference one does - would re-enter an allocator that is mid-update.
