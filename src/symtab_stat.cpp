/*
 * fstat, in bionic's layout.
 *
 * The fourth host-vs-bionic struct mismatch of this port, and the one
 * a long-standing quirk. The generated bionic
 * table binds fstat straight through to the host's, but the two sides do not
 * agree on what a `struct stat` is:
 *
 *   - bionic/armeabi-v7a uses the kernel's stat64 layout, 104 bytes, with
 *     32-bit time fields;
 *   - Debian trixie armhf is a 64-bit-time_t target, so the host's struct is
 *     a different size *and* has its members at different offsets.
 *
 * The game declares one on its stack and reads st_size out of offset 48. With
 * the host writing its own layout, that offset holds something else entirely,
 * and whatever the engine then does with the "size" of an asset - allocate it,
 * read into it, index it - is operating on a number that was never a size.
 *
 * So the fields are copied one at a time. There is no memcpy anywhere here on
 * purpose: the whole failure mode being fixed is the assumption that these two
 * structures have anything in common.
