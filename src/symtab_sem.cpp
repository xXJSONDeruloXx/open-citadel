/*
 * POSIX semaphores, in bionic's layout.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The failure
 *
 * Once com/eamobile/Query let the engine past its content gate it died every
 * run, at the same instruction, inside its own allocator:
 *
 *     FATAL: SIGSEGV at 0x00000008
 *            pc = ...+0x002539f8   str r1, [r3, #8]
 *            lr = ...+0x00256278
 *            r0 = <the GeneralAllocator>  r2 = 0x10c  r3 = 0x00000000
 *
 * +0x2539f8 is PPMalloc's insert-into-bin. It computes the bin from the chunk
 * size (`lsr r4, r2, #3` at +0x2539c4, so bin = size >> 3), loads the bin's
 * link pointer, and stores through it. Reading the allocator out of the core
 * dump showed the object is fully initialised - mbInitialized is 1 and all 127
 * bins are self-linked - except bin 0, which is the one bin PPMalloc's
 * InitBins loop deliberately skips (+0x254d68 starts at index 1). Landing in
 * bin 0 means size >> 3 == 0, i.e. a chunk whose size field is zero, and the
 * chunk at r1 confirmed it: its whole header, and forty bytes around it, read
 * back as zeros.
 *
 * So this was never an allocator bug. Something zeroed a live chunk header.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What zeroed it
 *
 * The port already carries four fixes of one shape - a bionic type that is
 * smaller than the host's, bound straight through, so the host writes past the
 * end of what the game reserved (pthread_attr_t 24 vs 36, pthread_mutex_t 4 vs
 * 24, struct timeval 8 vs 16, struct stat 104 vs the time64 one). sem_t is the
 * fifth and it is the worst of them:
 *
 *     bionic/libc/include/semaphore.h, ILP32:
 *         typedef struct { volatile unsigned int count; } sem_t;   // 4 bytes
 *     glibc/arm-linux-gnueabihf:
 *         union { char __size[16]; long int __align; } sem_t;      // 16 bytes
 *
 * thunks/libc/generated/impl_tab.h binds all nine sem_* entries with
 * THUNK_DIRECT, which is correct on any libc whose sem_t is one word and wrong
 * here. sem_init() then writes sixteen bytes - a small count followed by
 * twelve zeros - into a four-byte object. The engine allocates its semaphores
 * out of its own heap, so those twelve zero bytes land on whatever PPMalloc
 * put next, which is the following chunk's prev_size and size fields. The
 * allocator survives until the next time it walks that bin, and then binds a
 * zero-size chunk into bin 0 and stores through a null.
 *
 * That is why the fault looked like allocator corruption from inside the
 * allocator and had nothing to do with it, and why it moved to a different
 * milestone rather than a different address: the overwrite is deterministic,
 * only its discovery is deferred.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The bridge
 *
 * Same shape as the pthread_mutex_t bridge in src/symtab_pthread.cpp: the four
 * bytes the game owns hold a pointer to a real host sem_t allocated on the
 * side. It is simpler than the mutex case in one respect - POSIX has no static
 * initialiser for a semaphore, sem_init is always called explicitly - so there
 * is no "is this word a pointer or a bionic init constant?" ambiguity to
 * resolve, and no lazy creation path.
 *
 * A semaphore copied by value would copy the pointer and end up shared, and
 * destroying either copy would leave the other dangling. Not defended against,
 * deliberately: copying a sem_t is undefined behaviour in POSIX too, the
 * mutex bridge next to this one made the same call, and a guard would cost a
 * lookup on every sem_wait in the engine's audio path.
