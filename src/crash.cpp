/*
 * Fault reporting for the loaded module. See crash.h.
 *
 * The module is mapped at a base the loader chooses at runtime and it is not a
 * file the debugger can open anyway - it lives inside the user's APK. So the
 * one thing worth printing is the faulting PC *relative to the module's text*,
 * which is directly usable:
 *
 *     arm-linux-gnueabihf-objdump -d --start-address=0x<off-0x20> \
 *         --stop-address=0x<off+0x20> /tmp/g.so
 *
 * Everything below runs inside a signal handler on whichever thread faulted,
 * so it uses write(2) and hand-rolled hex only: no printf, no malloc, no
 * locks. After reporting it restores the default action and re-raises, so the
 * process still dies exactly as it would have.

 * pointers are out too - the game is built -fomit-frame-pointer like every
 * NDK release.
 *

 * stack word by word and print everything that points into the module's text.
 * It reports call sites that already returned as well as live frames, so it is
 * a list of suspects rather than a backtrace - but every real frame is in it,
 * and that is what turns "SIGSEGV somewhere in the C++ runtime" into a
 * specific engine function to disassemble.
 *
 * Thumb return addresses have bit 0 set; the offsets are printed with it
 * cleared so they can be pasted straight into objdump --start-address.
 */
/*
 * Is this word plausibly a return address, or just data that happens to fall

 *
 * The range check alone is not enough, and the reason is a detail of the
 * loader: text_size is the whole PT_LOAD segment, not just .text, so every
 * pointer-shaped constant in .rodata and .data passes it. A report full of
 * those is worse than no report - one run appeared to show an infinite
 * recursion between two addresses that objdump says are not code at all, and
 * that cost time to disbelieve.
 *
 * A real return address always has a call immediately before it. This game is
 * ARM throughout - no Thumb in the disassembly - so the four forms that can
 * precede one are cheap to recognise:
 *
 *     BL / BLcond      cond 101 1 <imm24>
 *     BLX <imm>        1111 101 <H> <imm24>
 *     BLX <reg>        cond 0001 0010 ... 0011 <Rm>
 *     ldr pc, [...]    the `mov lr, pc ; ldr pc, [r3]` virtual-call pair this
 *                      engine uses everywhere, where lr points just past the
 *                      load
 *
 * False positives are still possible - data can encode a valid BL - but they
 * drop from "most lines" to "rare", which is the difference between a list of
 * suspects and noise.
