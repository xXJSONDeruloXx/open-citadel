/*
 * Where the C++ unwinder is supposed to find the exception tables.
 *
 * entirely the game's business - except for one hole the ABI leaves open. On
 * ARM the unwind data is not walked from a frame pointer, it is looked up in a
 * sorted table (.ARM.exidx) keyed by the return address, and libgcc does not
 * know where that table lives. It asks:
 *
 *     _Unwind_Ptr __gnu_Unwind_Find_exidx(_Unwind_Ptr pc, int *pcount);
 *
 * On a device bionic answers it by searching the dynamic linker's list of
 * loaded objects. Here the host's libgcc answers it instead - and its
 * implementation searches the *host* linker's list, via dl_iterate_phdr.
 * out of a zip file with mmap, so as far as glibc is concerned those pages are
 * anonymous memory belonging to nothing.
 *
 * The result is not a crash at the lookup. It is worse, because it looks like
 * a bug in the game: the lookup returns "no table", _Unwind_RaiseException
 * gives up with _URC_FAILURE, __cxa_throw treats that as "no handler exists
 * anywhere" and calls std::terminate. Every throw in the module becomes fatal
 * even when the very next frame has a matching catch.
 *
 *
 *     std::terminate -> the default handler -> strb r2,[0xdeadcab1] -> abort
 *
 * (0xdeadcab1 is gabi++'s deliberate poison store, so a tombstone names the
 * cause; here it just surfaced as SIGSEGV at 0xdeadcab1.)
 *
 * A sibling port never needed this. Same engine, same unwinder - it simply never
 * threw on the paths the port reaches, so the hole stayed invisible.
 *
 * The fix is to answer the question ourselves for the modules this loader
 * mapped, and to hand everything else back to the host's implementation, which
 * is still the right answer for a PC inside SDL or the C library.
