 * shipped /usr/lib32/libmali.so.0 whose 32-bit dependencies were never
 * installed, so SDL reported "Can't load EGL/GL library on window creation",
 * every GLES1 import resolved to nil and the loader died with 182 missing
 * implementations.
 *
 * Only a real dlopen from a 32-bit process answers "can this be loaded?", and
 * this binary is the one 32-bit process the port is guaranteed to have. Hence
